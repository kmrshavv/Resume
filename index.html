                <h3>Smart door using ardino uno</h3>
                <p>Creating a smart door using an Arduino Uno involves integrating several components to enable 
                    features like remote locking/unlocking, monitoring door status, and possibly even motion detection.
                     The essential components needed for this project include an Arduino Uno, a servo motor or electronic lock,
                      a magnetic door sensor or reed switch, a PIR motion sensor (optional), a Wi-Fi module such as the ESP8266, 
                      a push button for manual override, LEDs for status indication, a breadboard, jumper wires, a power 
                      supply appropriate for the components, and resistors if necessary. The setup begins with connecting 
                      the servo motor to the Arduino, with its power wire connected to the 5V pin, ground wire to a GND pin,
                       and signal wire to a digital PWM pin like pin 9. The magnetic door sensor connects to a digital pin (e.g., pin 2) and GND,
                        and may require a pull-up resistor if it is a normally open sensor. If incorporating a PIR motion sensor, its VCC and GND 
                        pins connect to 5V and GND on the Arduino, and its output pin to a digital pin such as pin 3. The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module connects
                         to the Arduino using appropriate logic levels, with VCC connected to 3.3V, GND to GND, TX to RX (pin 0), and RX to TX (pin 1).
                          The push button connects one leg to a digital pin like pin 4 and the other leg to GND, with a pull-up resistor if needed. 
                          LEDs for status indication connect via current-limiting resistors to digital pins and GND. The Arduino code initializes these 
                          components and monitors the door sensor, motion sensor, and push button states to control the servo motor, indicating door status with LEDs.
                           For remote control, the ESP8266 can be used to connect to a Wi-Fi network and create a web server or MQTT client. Additional features like 
                           notifications via IFTTT and enhanced security through encryption and authentication can be integrated to improve functionality and security.
                            Testing each component individually before full integration is crucial for a smooth setup and operation of the smart door system.</p>

                <h3>Smoke detection system using arduino</h3>
                <p>Creating a smoke detection system using an Arduino involves integrating an MQ-2 smoke sensor to detect smoke 
                    levels and trigger alarms or notifications. The essential components for this project include an Arduino Uno,
                     an MQ-2 smoke sensor, a buzzer for audible alerts, an LED for visual indication, resistors if necessary,
                      a breadboard, jumper wires, and a suitable power supply. Begin by connecting the MQ-2
                       smoke sensor: the VCC pin to the Arduino's 5V, GND to GND, and the analog output (A0) to an analog input pin (e.g., A0)
                        on the Arduino. Next, connect the buzzer by attaching its positive leg to a digital pin (e.g., pin 8) and its negative leg to GND. 
                        Similarly, connect the LED by attaching its anode (long leg) to a digital pin (e.g., pin 7) through a current-limiting resistor 
                        (e.g., 220Î©) and its cathode (short leg) to GND. The Arduino code initializes these components and continuously reads the sensor
                         value from the MQ-2. If the sensor value exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 300), the system activates the LED and buzzer to
                          indicate smoke detection. To enhance the system, integrate an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to send remote notifications via platforms like IFTTT or Blynk, 
                          and consider adding an LCD or OLED display for real-time smoke level readings. Calibration of the MQ-2 sensor according to the manufacturer's guidelines can improve accuracy.
                           Ensuring a stable power supply, possibly with battery backup, is crucial for reliable operation. This setup provides a foundational smoke detection system that can be 
                           expanded with additional features and network capabilities for improved functionality. Regular testing and proper placement in critical areas are essential for effective smoke detection.</p>

                <h3>smart irrigation system using Arduino</h3>
                <p>Creating a smart irrigation system using Arduino involves automating the watering process based on soil moisture levels. Essential components include an Arduino Uno,
                     soil moisture sensor, relay module, water pump or solenoid valve, and optionally, a DHT11 or DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity monitoring.
                    Connect the soil moisture sensor to an analog input pin on the Arduino, and the relay module to a digital pin to control the water pump. Optionally,
                     connect the DHT sensor to monitor environmental conditions. The Arduino code reads the soil moisture and environmental data, activating the water pump
                      when the soil is dry. Additional features can include Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring, an RTC module for scheduling, solar power for sustainability,
                       multiple irrigation zones, and weather integration to prevent overwatering. Ensure safe power supply connections to prevent electrical hazards.</p>

                <h3>UAV scenario using UAV Toolbox and Simulink in MATLAB</h3>
                <p>To simulate a UAV scenario using UAV Toolbox and Simulink in MATLAB, initialize your UAV scenario with meshes
                     and `uavPlatform` objects, and add a ground mesh and cylindrical obstacles for lidar scanning. Create two UAV platforms with initial positions and orientations.
                      Attach a lidar sensor to the first UAV platform using `uavSensor`. In Simulink, open the `UAVScenarioModel.slx` and configure the UAV Scenario Configuration block
                       with your scenario. Use the UAV Scenario Motion Write block to update the first UAV's Motion bus, and the UAV Scenario Motion Read block to read the motion data. 
                       Use the UAV Scenario Get Transform block to get the transformation matrix between the UAVs. Connect the UAV Scenario Lidar block to a UAV Scenario Scope 
                       block for visualization, and run the model to animate and visualize the UAV's motion and lidar readings.</p>
